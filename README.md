### Project title
Quickly

### What and why?
When I have to run my errands, I often find myself forgetting things I have to do or doubling back to places I've already been, adding on unnecessary stress, travel and time. I waste a lot of my time traveling all around town, crossing paths, turning back, or just missing commitments because I lack a proper way to plot my itinerary in a meaningful way. My proposal is an app that allows users to log tasks, while also providing a route with the shortest distance between each stop. With a system that allows me to thoughtfully plan out my tasks for the day or week, I can have more time for more meaningful tasks, while knocking out the frivolous errands in a more timely manner.

### For whom?
This system will apply to any average user who has a busy schedule and also wants to minimize the amount of time spent traveling to each task they have to accomplish. They will be looking for a simple and concise planning portal that will effortlessly calculate a route for their inputs.

### How?
The proposed app would be able to receive a few inputs from the user... <br />

    - address where they need to go (place)
    - what they need to do (action)

Based on the geographical location on the place or places the user inputs, the system will return to the user a route that stops at each location, but in the shortest and most efficient path, while also providing the user a notes like interface to allow them to jot down lists or any additional notes.

### Scope
This project could be tackled by a team of 6 engineers with most of the time being spent on determining how to create the shortest path and displaying this in a meaningful way. An additional aspect that I was not sure how to incorporate would be time - of certain commitments and how to create the path if a user has specific times to be at locations or to spend at locations. The project will be a challenge in the sense of figuring out how to make the shortest path, but simple in the methods of returning to the user in an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
