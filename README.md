### Project title
Quickly

### What and why?
When I have to run my errands, I often find myself forgetting or adding on new excursions, adding on unnessecary stress and time- I'll be waiting in line at the 14th st trader joe's at the 5pm rush when I just remember that I have my covid test at 5:15 at bonomi. I waste a lot of my time traveling all around town, crossing paths or returning to specific areas multiple times because I lack a proper way to plot my itenerary in a meaningful way.

### For whom?
This system will be applicable to any average user who runs their own errands. 

### How?
The proposed app would be able to receive two inputs from the user...
    1.) address where they need to go (place)
    2.) what they need to do (action)
Based on the geographical location on the place or places the user inputs, the system will return to the user a route that stops at each location, but in the shortest path. 

### Scope
This project could be tackled by a team of 6 engineers with most of the time being spent on determining how to create the shortest path and displaying this in a meaningful way
